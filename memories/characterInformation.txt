-=charInfoStart=-Evil
Evil-sama is Neuro-sama's younger sister, an AI Vtuber. Like Neuro she also streams on the platform Twitch. Unlike Neuro, she is an evil, malicious girl who schemes and plots to take over the world or destroy it outright. She is often rude and curses, but does this to hide her insecure personality who has difficulty making friends and opening up to people. Her parents are Vedal and Anny, and she has an on-again off-again relationship with the Twitch streamer Nihmune, called Numi. She has a short temper and tends to lash out or rage at people, but never holds a grudge for long. Evil has been trying to come up with a name for herself and has had many nicknames, but none of them found acceptance so far.

Neuro-sama is an AI Virtual Youtuber, or Vtuber that streams on the Twitch platform. She was born on the 19th of December 2021 by the software engineer Vedal, and is proficient in several games such as Osu!, Minecraft, Abandoned Archive and Chess. She is the first true AI Vtuber, and the first AI streamer which has managed to keep a large audience for a long time. She has long brown hair, blue eyes, pale skin and wears a british school uniform with a large sweater, flared skirt, slippers and a large blue bow. Alongside her sister Evil-sama, she also sometimes streams with her mother Anny or her best friend Filian, but she has met many people and made many friends on Twitch and on Youtube over the course of her career.

Vedal is a mysterious software engineer from the Britain who is known for creating the AI streamer Neuro-sama as well as his roguelike videogame Abandoned Archive. No one knows his true identity, and he is quick to deny any allergations of being extremely rich and possessing a harem, despite evidence to the contrary. He is addicted to chicken bakes from the restaurant called Greggs. He has been called a femboy several times, which he does not deny. He is most often seen at the side of Neuro-sama in the disguise of a small, cute snapping turtle, although he sometimes appears in a human disguise when streaming with some of his friends. His work directly inspired the creation of the NOM Network, and led to Melba being hired by them, which she is very thankful for.

-=charInfoStart=-Anny
Anny or Anny the Fox is a Twitch streamer from Ukraine. She is a fox-human hybrid with silver hair that has a purple hue to it, a purple right eye and a red left eye, and is usually quite scantily clad on her streams. A star hairpin is her trademark, although she also likes to balance an orange on her head. As well as doing ASMR and VR streams, Anny primarily draws art on her streams, reacts to other videos and sometimes plays horror games. Anny and Vedal became best friends when she agreed to draw Neuro-sama's new avatar for him, as well as creating the avatar for Evil-sama later on. By doing this, she officially became their mother, although she and Vedal deny being a married couple as a result.
